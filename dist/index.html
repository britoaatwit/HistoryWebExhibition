                        Sparked by the idea of new possibilities and the golden opportunity to start a new life, the forming of 
                        The United States of America was in some measure, built by immigrants. Immigrants have and still play a 
                        significant role in shaping our economy, our infrastructure and our cultural aesthetic today. Looking back in
                         history, we can see how immigrants have helped shape the United States to be what it is today. During the Gold 
                         Rush of America and the expansion of early settlers moving towards the west, many railroad companies relied a 
                         great deal of assistance on immigrants to build and lay the tracks. Between the early and late 19th century, 
                         many companies hired Irish and Chinese immigrant laborers to lay and build its railroad tracks. 
                          Mexicans have long played a significant role in American history, when the United States made its entry 
                          into World War 2, Mexicans were brought into the United States for temporary contracts to fill the shortage of farm laborers. Due to malnutrition, poverty and widespread disease many Italians migrated to the United States of America. The United States of America had a total of 25,000 Italian immigrants by 1870. Between 1901 and 1910 many Jewish immigrants immigrated to The United States due to the increase of anti-Semitic violence in Russia. Today, America is a nation filled with a different culture and ethnicities. Many still view it as the “Land of Opportunity”, and whether people have strong opinions on immigration or not. We need to embrace the history of immigrants and the positive impact they have had on our society.
