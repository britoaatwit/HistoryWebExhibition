                        The United States of America is a nation that gives people the opportunity and hope for a better life. 
                        A nation that promises you that if you work hard for what you want, you can reach your goals and you can become 
                        whoever you want. A nation that makes up many different ethnic groups,  a true melting pot of different cultures. 
                        The history of immigrants coming to the United States to seek a new and better life, has helped us bring new cultural 
                        ideas into our own accustomed values. Although born in a different country, immigrants 
                        have proven to have the capability to assimilate to American culture. The belief of the concept that working hard will get you 
                        the opportunity to make something of yourself and for your family is rooted in the spirit of the hard working immigrant. 
                        From the Irish, Chinese, Russian, Italian, Mexican and
                        many more. Immigrants have helped build our economy and to keep things running in the United States. 
                        Today there is a lot of political debate on immigration policy. I believe there should be rules put in place for
                        immigration. But I also think that it is morally wrong to deny a person the opportunity to live in the United States, 
                        if they are seeking the opportunity to make a better life for their themselves and their family. From the Pilgrim Voyage
                        to the wave immigrants that came in the 18th century, we as Americans need to embrace the fact that we all came from a 
                        different place, in hopes to live a better life.
